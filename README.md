# The Eying App ðŸ‘€

The Eying App is an object detection application built using Streamlit ðŸŽª, capable of analyzing images for objects and annotating them with bounding boxes.

This app uses the Hugging Face Transformers library with `Facebook detr-resnet-101` object detection model.

Although it's not working due to a small error that needs to be fixed, here's the link, stay tuned:
### Eying App: [here](https://eying-object-detection-tool.streamlit.app/)
